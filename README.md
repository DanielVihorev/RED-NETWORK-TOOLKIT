# RED-NETWORK-TOOLKIT
The script is a basic penetration testing tool designed to automate the process of testing a remote machine for vulnerabilities.

Here’s a brief explanation of what the script does:

**Summary:**  
The script is a basic penetration testing tool designed to automate the process of testing a remote machine for vulnerabilities.

**How it works:**
1. **Ping the Target:**  
   The script first checks if the target machine (IP address) is online by sending a ping request.

2. **TCP Port Scanning:**  
   If the target is up, it scans all (or a specified range of) TCP ports on the target machine to see which ports are open.

3. **SSH Brute-Force Attack:**  
   If port 22 (the default SSH port) is open, the script tries to log in by systematically testing combinations of usernames and passwords from pre-defined lists (brute-force attack).

4. **Result Reporting:**  
   If it successfully logs in, it prints out the correct username and password that allow SSH access.

**Main Technologies Used:**
- `socket` or `scapy` for network actions (pinging and port scanning)
- `paramiko` for SSH connections and brute-forcing

**Purpose:**  
This script demonstrates fundamental concepts in network security and penetration testing: host discovery, port scanning, and brute-forcing credentials. It’s typically used for educational or authorized security testing purposes only.

Here’s a clean and concise explanation of those libraries, perfect for adding to your README under a section like “📚 Library Overview”:

⸻

🧩 Libraries Used

This script leverages several powerful Python libraries to enable network interaction, remote access, and command execution:

🔌 socket

The socket module is part of Python’s standard library and provides low-level networking interfaces.
Used for:
	•	Creating and managing TCP/UDP connections
	•	IP resolution and port scanning
	•	Listening for incoming connections (server behavior)

Example: Opening a TCP socket to scan ports or communicate with a host.

⸻

🛡️ paramiko

paramiko is a third-party library used to implement SSHv2 protocol functionalities in Python.
Used for:
	•	Establishing SSH sessions
	•	Executing commands remotely on Linux/Unix machines
	•	Authenticating via password or private key

Example: Automating remote command execution or file transfer over secure SSH.

⸻

⚙️ subprocess

The subprocess module allows Python code to spawn and control system processes.
Used for:
	•	Running native OS commands like ping, nmap, or ifconfig
	•	Capturing stdout/stderr for further processing
	•	Bridging between Python logic and system tools

Example: Gathering host data using system commands or launching other scripts.

⸻

🧰 typing.List

The List type hint from Python’s typing module helps with code clarity and static analysis.
Used for:
	•	Indicating that a function accepts or returns a list of elements
	•	Improving readability and IDE autocomplete support
	•	Enabling tools like MyPy to validate types

Example:

def scan_hosts(hosts: List[str]) -> List[str]:
    ...

🌟 Enhancements

1. 📦 Installation

Provide step‑by‑step guidance:

git clone https://github.com/DanielVihorev/Red-Network-Toolkit.git
cd Red-Network-Toolkit
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate         # On Windows: .\env\Scripts\activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

If you’re not using a requirements file yet:

pip install scapy requests dnspython
# and any other libs your script uses

2. 🛠️ Usage Examples

Show common command patterns and options:

python network_attack_script.py --host 192.168.1.1 --scan tcp
python network_attack_script.py -r 10.0.0.0/24 --banner

Explain each flag (like --scan, --banner, --honeypot-check, etc.) with a short description and examples.

3. ⚙️ Configuration

If your script uses a config file (like config.yml or .ini):
	•	Preview the default config file structure.
	•	Mention editable parameters (API keys, timeouts, output paths).

4. 🔧 Features

List core capabilities:
	•	TCP/UDP/SYN port scanning
	•	Banner grabbing
	•	ICMP ping sweep
	•	Reverse IP lookups
	•	DNS enumeration and mapping
	•	Honeypot probability heuristics
	•	Censys/Shodan integrations (if present)
	•	MAC address lookups

5. ⚠️ Ethical & Legal Disclaimer

Important to include:

⚠️ Warning: This tool is intended strictly for legitimate, authorized network testing (e.g., pentesting, security audits). Unauthorized scanning or use against systems/networks you don’t own or have permission to test may be illegal and unethical.

6. 📊 Sample Output

Provide screenshots or terminal snippets:

> python network_attack_script.py --scan 192.168.1.0/24
[+] Host 192.168.1.10 – ports open: 22(tcp), 80(http)
[+] Banner from 22: OpenSSH_8.4p1 Ubuntu-5ubuntu1.2
...

7. 📚 Dependencies & Compatibility

List required Python version(s) and OS support:
	•	Python 3.8+
	•	Linux, macOS, Windows
	•	Python packages: Scapy, Requests, dnspython, etc.

8. 🧪 Testing

If you’ve written tests:

pytest tests/

If not, you can mention manual testing suggestions or even include a basic test suite.

9. 🗺️ Roadmap / Planned Enhancements

Outline upcoming features:
	•	IPv6/ARP scanning
	•	More stealthy packet options
	•	JSON or HTML output support
	•	Integration with Nessus, ZAP, or Splunk
